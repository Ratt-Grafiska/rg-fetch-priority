# fetch-prority
 This plugin enhances the WordPress block editor by adding a fetchpriority attribute to the Image and Cover blocks. The fetchpriority attribute helps optimize loading behavior by prioritizing specific images for faster rendering, improving Core Web Vitals and overall page performance.      With this plugin, users can easily configure the fetchpriority setting directly from the block settings panel in the editor. Available options include:      Default (empty) – No priority set, follows browser behavior.   High – Marks the image as a high priority, ensuring it loads sooner.   Auto – Allows the browser to decide the priority dynamically.   By using this feature, developers and content creators can fine-tune image loading strategies to improve page speed and user experience.
